# CN Project Phase 2

This is a simple server-client implementation using TCP. The project includes functionality for sending messages, files, and even some fun options! Note that only one client is allowed to connect to the server at a time.

## Environment

This project is designed to run on **macOS Sonoma 14.6.1**. Compatibility with other macOS versions or operating systems is not guaranteed. 

---

## Dependencies

This project requires the following external libraries:

1. **OpenSSL**  
   - Used for secure connections between the server and client.
   - Installation:
     ```bash
     brew install openssl
     ```
   - Ensure OpenSSL is linked correctly:
     ```bash
     export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib"
     export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include"
     ```

2. **PortAudio**  
   - Used for audio processing and playback.
   - Installation:
     ```bash
     brew install portaudio
     ```

3. **mpg123**  
   - Used for decoding MP3 files for audio playback.
   - Installation:
     ```bash
     brew install mpg123
     ```

4. **Standard C Libraries**  
   - Used for basic input/output and networking (`<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, `<string.h>`, `<arpa/inet.h>`, `<unistd.h>`).

Ensure these libraries are properly installed before running the project.

## Features

This implementation includes the following features:
- Sending and receiving messages between the client and server.
- Sending messages to other clients.
- Registering and logging in users.
- Sending files to other clients.
- Receiving files from other clients.
- Fun and interactive options, including audio playback with PortAudio and mpg123.
- Encrypted message transfer.
- Beautiful and colorful client terminal interface.

## Usage

Follow these steps to compile and run the server and client:

1. **Compile the Server and Client**
   Use the provided `Makefile` to compile both the server and client programs:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
2. **Start the Server**
    ```bash
    ./server [port_number]
    ```
3. **Start the Client**
    We support up to 10 clients for a single server.
    ```bash
    ./client [port_number]
    ```

4. **Example**
    ```bash
    ./server 8080
    ./client 8080
    ```

If the makefile can't run properly on your machine, you can directly use the executable file "server" and "client" in the code directory to run the program.
